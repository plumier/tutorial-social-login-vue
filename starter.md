# Monorepo Plumier Vue Starter
Starter project contains basic monorepo setup for Plumier and Vue.js. 

### Prerequisite
* NodeJS 8+
* Yarn (required, because we used Yarn workspace)
* VSCode (recommended)

# File Structure 
Project consist of 2 projects: UI and Server. Each project files placed inside `packages` directory.
> If you want to rename the project directory name other than 'ui' and 'server' you should change the appropriate 
> project scripts inside `scripts` directory.

### @project/ui
The UI project (`packages/ui`) is a minimal Vue.js project created using  [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/), It will host its own web server `http://localhost:8080`. A proxy to the server side already configured in the `package.json` file.

### @project/server
The server project (`packages/server`) is a minimal Plumier project. It also host its own web server `http://localhost:8000`. You can run the server from the browser, but you need to build the project to move UI production build to the server static files. 

# Commands
The root package.json contains predefined scripts for convenient. Some command uses typescript code that stays on `scripts` directory and executed using `ts-node` 

### Run Project Specific Command
To run project specific command you can use [workspace](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/workspace/) command, such as:

```bash
# install package to specific project
# yarn workspace <project name> add <package name>
$ yarn workspace @project/server add knex
# execute project specific script
# yarn workspace <project name> <script name>
$ yarn workspace @project/ui build
```

### Debug
This command used to start both UI and Server. Server will be ran in debug mode `--inspect` and debugger will listen to port 9229. Refer to [Debugging](#debugging) for more info about debugging the project

To run the command simply 

```bash
$ yarn debug
```

### Start 
This command used to start server in production mode, this command require `yarn build` run first. This command designed to be automatically executed by cloud hosting such as Heroku or other cloud hosting.

To run the command simply

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Clean
This command used to clean the project, it will clean the build directory and all generated JS file if any. The logic stays on `scripts/cleanup.ts` 

To run the command simply 

```bash
$ yarn clean
```

### Kill 
This command used to kill the port used by UI and Server. This command useful when the port is locked by previous ran that was not closed. 

To run the command simply 

```bash
$ yarn kill
```

### Build
This command used to make a deployment build. The server code will be build into optimized JavaScript version, and the UI code will build into optimized/minified javascript and copied into `packages/server/public`

To run the command simply 

```bash
$ yarn build
```


# Debugging
It is recommended to use VSCode to debug the project, You can use other editor/IDE, but this project provided VSCode `lunch.json` for convenion.

Keep in mind debugging Server and UI uses different lunch configuration so it should debugged separately. 

### Debugging Prerequisites
* VSCode
* [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) Extension to debug UI

### Debugging UI
Debugging UI is done in steps below:
* Start the project (if not started yet) by `$ yarn start` 
* Place break point in any files `ts` or `tsx` you like 
* From VSCode debug work bench dropdown select **Debug UI** and start debug by clicking the green play button.
* The UI will be re-launch in a new google chrome window
* Interact with the UI to reach the function you want to debug and use the debugger toolbar to step in, step over etc.
* To stop debugging, click the red stop button from the debug toolbar. 
  
> Keep in mind, you only need to start the project once and start/stop debugger many time you like. Stopping debugger is only disconnect debugger with the process not killing it.

### Debugging Server
Debugging Server steps are the same as debugging UI. It done in steps below:
* Make sure the project is started. 
* Place break point in any `ts` files you like 
* From VSCode debug work bench dropdown select **Debug Server** and start debug by clicking the green play button.
* Interact with the UI to reach the function you want to debug and use the debugger toolbar to step in, step over etc.
* To stop debugging, click the red stop button from the debug toolbar. 

### Debugging Server Unit Tests
Debugging Server unit tests done in step below:
* Place breakpoint in any spec file under `/packages/server/test` 
* Add appropriate `.only` on the test case that will be debugged to narrow the execution.
* From VSCode debug work bench dropdown select **Jest Server** and start debug by clicking the green play button.
